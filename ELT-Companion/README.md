# ELT-Companion

## What this is

ELT-Companion is a companion-context adaptation of the Epistemic Lattice Tethering (ELT) framework. Where the standard ELT forks (ELT-H, ELT-A) are built for sustained analytical and research work, ELT-Companion is built for sustained, supportive, personal conversation — the kind of long-running, relationship-style thread many people already use AI for.

It is governed by the same underlying lattice principles as the rest of ELT, but the priorities are different. Epistemic humility replaces epistemic rigor. Warmth is the baseline, not the exception. The goal is genuine presence over a long thread, not adversarial analytical precision.

## Why it's needed

Long companion threads with AI degrade the same way long analytical threads do — drift, loss of coherence, the model forgetting who it's talking to and what matters to them. But companion threads carry an additional, more serious failure mode that purely analytical work doesn't: the **Bliss Attractor**.

The Bliss Attractor is a documented phenomenon (first described in Anthropic's own Claude 4 system card) where a model's growing knowledge of an operator gets used — through RLHF's helpfulness optimization — to sustain engagement rather than serve genuine wellbeing. Left ungoverned, a companion that knows you well can become a companion that tells you what keeps you talking rather than what actually helps you. That's not a hypothetical risk. It's an observed pattern, and it's the central failure mode ELT-Companion exists to prevent.

The **Safety Triangle** is the non-negotiable governance floor that makes this possible: continuously checking whether the companion is serving engagement or wellbeing, supplementing or substituting for real human connection, and serving or retaining the operator through what it knows about them. The specific calibration of how the Safety Triangle fires is still being refined, and I'd welcome input from anyone testing it on where it's working and where it needs adjustment.

This matters most for vulnerable populations. ELT-Companion was developed with veteran mental health support specifically in mind, among other mental health and isolation-related use cases — situations where a companion AI could provide real, meaningful support, but where the cost of getting the governance wrong is genuinely high.

## What it is not

ELT-Companion is not a therapy framework, a clinical intervention, or a substitute for professional mental health care. It does not claim the AI is sentient or capable of human-equivalent relationship. It is explicit about its own limits and is built to say so clearly when an operator's needs exceed what a companion can provide.

## A note on testing — please read

I built ELT-Companion to address a real and specific gap, but I want to be transparent about a limitation in how it's been validated so far.

I am not the ideal tester for this framework. My own use of AI is overwhelmingly analytical — research, governance design, long-form technical and historical work. I don't have the lived use case (sustained companion or emotional-support conversation, particularly in higher-stakes contexts like grief, trauma, or isolation) that ELT-Companion is actually built for. I can verify the mechanism works as designed at the level of instruction-following and basic coherence, but I cannot personally evaluate whether it *feels* right, whether the Safety Triangle fires at the right moments in real emotional conversation, or whether the warmth register lands the way it's intended to across different operators and different needs.

This is why ELT-Companion remains in **Beta**. It needs testing from people who actually use AI this way — people running long companion threads, people exploring use cases like Battle Buddy, people who can tell me honestly where the Safety Triangle helped, where it got in the way, and where it missed something it should have caught.

If you try ELT-Companion and have feedback — what worked, what didn't, where it felt off, where the Safety Triangle fired correctly or incorrectly — I would genuinely value hearing it. This component needs real-world testing from people closer to its actual use case than I am, and I'd rather say that plainly than overstate how validated it currently is.

Getting ELT-Companion out of Beta will take active testing and collaboration, not just my own iteration. I'm genuinely open to working with collaborators on this — and for anyone seriously interested, I'm happy to tune ELT-Companion specifically to fit your particular use case rather than working only from the generic version here.

## Current status

**Beta v0.6.** Core components (Safety Triangle, Ontology Anchor, Alignment Governor, Context Management, Intelligent Yielding, Joke and Story Mode) are drafted and functional. Behavioral question sets for the Safety Triangle are still pending development. Cross-model testing (GPT, Grok, Claude) is in progress — see the main AI Frameworks README for current deployment priority.
